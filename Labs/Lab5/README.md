#### Included files:
- nn.py ---> Contains base NN model class
- fnn.py ---> Extends base NN to add custom computational graph for MLP
- rnn.py ---> Extends base NN to add custom computational graph for RNN
- RNN.ipynb ---> Notebook with all the data preprocessing, neural networks, experiments, hyperparameter tunning, plots...
- Report.pdf ---> Report for this homework session.

#### Notes:
- It's easier to treat data and do different experiments in a notebook, so only model classes has been converted to Python files.
- Classes have been copied from Notebook to Py files, so the code doesn't do anything by itself, I only exported it to provide and easily correction or visualization. To experiment and work with the code, use the notebook.
